// CookingStation.OnAddFuelSwitch/FindCookableItem) follows that mod. The bodies are rewritten

    /// <summary>
    /// Crafting, upgrading and building may consume materials straight out of nearby chests, and
    /// smelters / fires may be fed from them, with one toggle per station family.
    ///
    /// COOKING STATIONS ARE OFF BY DEFAULT, THE OVEN IS ON. Meat racks, the iron cooking station
    /// and the stone oven all carry a CookingStation component, and the group wants raw meat kept
    /// for recipes rather than silently vanishing onto the nearest rack. So the CookingStation
    /// gate is split in two:
    ///
    ///   PullForCookingStations (false)  every CookingStation prefab, racks included
    ///   PullForOvens (true) + OvenPrefabs ("piece_oven")  only the named prefabs
    ///
    /// A station pulls if EITHER is satisfied, so PullForCookingStations keeps its old
    /// "all of them" meaning and the oven can bake bread out of a chest while the racks stay
    /// manual. The cauldron (piece_cauldron) and CookingAdditions' BCA_CookingPot are
    /// CraftingStations, not CookingStations - they never reach this gate at all and already pull
    /// via PullForCrafting.
    ///
    /// HOW IT COMPOSES WITH TrailingTierDiscount
    /// -----------------------------------------
    /// That module decides HOW MANY of a thing a recipe costs (a GetAmount postfix driven by a
    /// thread-static tier context, plus an in-place scaling of Piece.Requirement.m_amount for the
    /// build check). This module decides WHERE those items come from. They are kept honest by
    /// Harmony's execution order:
    ///
    ///   prefixes -> original -> POSTFIXES -> finalizers
    ///
    /// Discount sets its context in a prefix and clears it in a FINALIZER, so every one of our
    /// POSTFIXES still sees discounted numbers - GetAmount() and Piece.Requirement.m_amount both
    /// read discounted while we run. And ConsumeResources is handled by a non-skipping prefix that
    /// only records inventory counts plus a postfix that pulls the shortfall: we never call
    /// GetAmount to decide how much left the player's inventory, we MEASURE it, so no ordering
    /// between the two modules (or a third mod) can make the counted, shown and consumed numbers
    /// disagree. The two modules also live in different declaring types, which is what keeps their
    /// Harmony __state slots separate.
    ///
    /// "REQUIRE ONLY ONE INGREDIENT" RECIPES (0.10.0)
    /// ------------------------------------------------
    /// A recipe with m_requireOnlyOneIngredient wants any ONE of its listed items, not all of them,
    /// and vanilla picks the concrete item via Player.GetFirstRequiredItem - which only ever looked
    /// at the player's own inventory. Two patches keep this consistent with everything above:
    ///
    ///   HaveRecipePost, for these recipes, checks each listed item against inventory+containers
    ///   (still just Available(), still read-only) and accepts the first one that clears the
    ///   needed amount - so the craft button agrees with what a real craft can actually get.
    ///
    ///   GetFirstRequiredItemPost fires when vanilla found nothing in the inventory: it looks for
    ///   the first listed item a nearby container can supply and returns a DETACHED CLONE of it,
    ///   exactly the trick CookingFindCookablePost already uses - vanilla's own removal, aimed at
    ///   an item that was never really in the bag, harmlessly finds nothing to remove. Unlike the
    ///   cooking patch, this one never calls ChestSource.Consume itself: it is read-only on
    ///   purpose, because GetFirstRequiredItem is also polled just to grey/ungrey the button, and a
    ///   container must never drain from being looked at. The actual debit happens exactly once,
    ///   generically, when DoCrafting goes on to call Player.ConsumeResources with a one-item
    ///   Requirement[] built around whatever item this method handed back - the existing
    ///   ConsumePre/ConsumePost measuring below does the rest, unchanged.
